# Conversation Transcript (from the start)

**User:** I want to create the doordash of vapes, starting in Texas and I need to know who provides ID and identify verification and car insurance and registration verification so I can be compliant with the laws uber apparently has to follow. I have a good breakdown of the problems the app has to solve (the dynamic assignment problem and routing for navigation, solutions to which I can rip out of google’s OR tools) What else should I be considering?

**Assistant:** (Provided compliance buckets for Texas + federal, vendor categories for ID/age verification, driver/vehicle verification considerations, and additional areas like licensing/taxes, doorstep flow, inventory/substitutions, payments/fraud, privacy, ops governance.)

**User:** Marketplace

**Assistant:** (Explained marketplace implications; Model A vs Model B; Texas delivery-sale requirements; compliance architecture; MVP checklist; state machines; sequence diagrams; build plan; default assumptions.)

**User:** Model A, and yes I’ll take the checklist and diagram

**Assistant:** (Delivered Model A checklist + architecture diagram + data model + dossier schema + sequence diagrams + build plan + defaults.)

**User:** Do it, the defaults are good

**Assistant:** (Produced engineer-ready: REST endpoints, dossier payload schemas, Postgres migrations, Texas-first compliance QA test plan, and PRD skeleton; offered to generate a repo skeleton.)

**User:** You decide

**Assistant:** (Chose FastAPI + Postgres, suggested stack and repo layout, key engineering choices; offered to output repo skeleton and tests.)

**User:** Sure and include the transcript of this entire conversation from the very start
